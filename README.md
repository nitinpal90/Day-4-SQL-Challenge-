ðŸš€ Day 4 of my SQL Challenge: Mastering Joins! ðŸš€

Today, I dove deep into the world of SQL joins, a crucial skill for any data enthusiast. Here's what I covered:

ðŸ”¹ Types of Joins in SQL
ðŸ”¹ Inner Join in SQL with Examples
ðŸ”¹ Left Join in SQL with Examples
ðŸ”¹ Right Join in SQL with Examples

Each type of join serves a unique purpose, helping us combine data from multiple tables in different ways. Whether it's retrieving common records with Inner Join, keeping all records from the left table with Left Join, or all records from the right table with Right Join, I've explored it all!

ðŸ’¡ Problem Statements: Worked on practical problems to solidify my understanding. Real-world data scenarios are now less intimidating!

This journey is about turning raw data into insightful stories. Can't wait to see where this SQL adventure takes me next! ðŸ’ª
